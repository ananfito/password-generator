## My Process

The goals for this project were to build a password generator from scrach in line with the Figma design specfications. I started with outline the HTML to include the needed elements (e.g., header, text, button, etc.) before proceeding to the CSS to style the page. Finally, I added the JavaScript variables and functions to generate the random passwords. The JavaScript makes use of a `for` loop, and the `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` methods to generator 15 different random numbers. These are then used as indices for an array with the characters.
